# Data Science Journey

Welcome to my **Data Science & AI Learning Journey**!  
This repository documents my **4-month intensive study plan** where I cover everything from **Python fundamentals** to **Machine Learning**, **data wrangling**, and **real-world projects**.

The goal of this journey is to:
- Build a **strong foundation** in data science and AI
- Document everything I learn through **notes**, **assignments**, and **resources**
- Create a **portfolio** that demonstrates my skills in afore mentioned fields
